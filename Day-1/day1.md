#  DevOps Training – Day 1 



---

## Introduction

DevOps is a methodology that bridges the gap between **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)**. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software in a continuous and automated manner.

This roadmap provides a foundational overview of the DevOps lifecycle, along with the tools and best practices followed at each stage.

---

## DevOps Lifecycle Overview

The DevOps lifecycle is typically visualized as a continuous loop consisting of the following stages:

1. **Development**
2. **Continuous Integration**
3. **Continuous Deployment**
4. **Continuous Monitoring**

Each of these stages plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless and automated delivery of applications.

---

## 1️ Development

### Objective:
Write, manage, and collaborate on code efficiently.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
- **IDE:** VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse  
- **Project Management:** Jira, Trello  

---

## 2️ Continuous Integration (CI)

###  Objective:
Automatically build and test code changes to detect issues early.

###  Tools & Technologies:
- **CI Servers:** Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI  
- **Build Tools:** Maven, Gradle, Ant  
- **Code Quality & Testing:** SonarQube, JUnit, Selenium  

---

## 3️ Continuous Deployment (CD)

### 🎯 Objective:
Deploy code to production or staging environments automatically and reliably.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes  
- **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Puppet, Chef  
- **Cloud & Deployment Services:** AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, Google Cloud Build  

---

## 4️⃣ Continuous Monitoring

### 🎯 Objective:
Track application performance, system health, and user activity to ensure stability and quick issue resolution.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies:
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix  
- **Logging:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- **APM Tools:** Datadog, New Relic, Splunk
